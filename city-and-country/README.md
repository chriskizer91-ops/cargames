# City & Country (working title)

Back Forty's game with City Limits' town, cars and night. Everything from Back Forty (its cars, machines, garage
window with the dyno lab and the Tune sheet, the Plus tune, the Sim level, the dev panel, the settings, the phone
controls) in a new world: City Limits' town at its own size in the middle, the country round it, and the salt
flats past that, under a full moon.

Open `city-and-country.html` in a browser with WebGL2. `sh build.sh` rebuilds it from `src/`.
Saves use `cc-` keys only, so nothing is shared with Back Forty (`b40-`) or City Limits (`cl-`).

## Where it comes from

- **Back Forty v9.1** (`back-forty/` on `back-forty/published`): every module, as the base.
- **City Limits v2** (`city-limits/` on `city-limits/published`): the town's plan (its `clmap.js`, districts, lots and
  buildings, lamps, signals, neon, palms, the park), the salt flats' ramps (`flats.js`), the cluster light grid
  (`render/lights.js`), the facade and salt looks (`render/glsl/world.js`), the full moon (`game/env.js`), and the
  three cars (`hd/34_ev`, `35_wedge`, `36_hyper`, `37_newbuilds`, `45_ev`, `58_clparts` -> `58_ccparts`).

## The world (`src/50_worldgen.js`)

Everything is a function of where you are, made in 128 m chunks round the car by a worker, as in Back Forty.
x runs east, z south; downtown is at the origin.

- **The town**: City Limits' grid of streets every 120 m inside Limits Boulevard (a ring 720 m across with rounded
  corners), its districts (Downtown's towers, Neon Row, the Heights, the Yards, Copper Park), the same size.
  Street classes for the road shader: 6 Highway 40, 7 the boulevard, 8 Central Avenue, 9 the avenues, 10 the
  streets, 11 the intersections (zebras). Sidewalks, curbs, medians, paved lots, buildings with lit windows and
  storefronts (material 60), traffic signals on a 30 s cycle (61), neon words, blade signs and strips, palms.
- **Highway 40**: three lanes each way with a painted median, straight through the middle of town east and west,
  lit a little way out of town, then dark across the country, and it just ends on the salt (barrels and a
  ROAD ENDS sign, at `HWY_X`, about 3.47 km out).
- **The country**: a mile grid of roads round town (lines at -1, 0, +1 miles): Ridge Road north into the hills
  (gravel), Wash Road south (dirt), the others blacktop, gravel or dirt a stretch at a time. Farms, creeks, woods,
  hills to the north, rolling ground, drier toward the salt. Deke's Gas east of town and the Starlite Diner west,
  on the highway. The bog south of town. Marisol's garage downtown, where the game starts.
- **The off-road park** (`PKW` in the generator, the clocks in `src/60_park.js`), west of town, north of the
  highway, in by Park Road from Highway 40 under a lit gate:
  - **Speedway 25**: HD's banked clay oval, half a mile round (14 degrees in the turns, 5 on the straights), a
    concrete wall and catch fence, a grandstand with a press box, eight light towers, haulers in the infield.
  - **The short course**: HD's, 1.8 km of loose dirt: two tabletops, the whoops, berms in the turns, a crest
    and the big sweeper home; a start gantry, tyre walls round the turns, flags.
  - **The mud track**: a 770 m loop sunk in the ground, the right way round, banked turns, a chicane and a
    splash of standing water; an arch with its name, round bales round the turns.
  - **The drag strip**: HD's eighth mile of packed dirt, two lanes, the tree, timing boards, fences, light poles,
    a little grandstand, bales at the end of the shutdown.
  - **The paddock**: a lot with haulers, the park office and its sign; a gravel lane north between the tracks.
  - Each track is a path of lines and arcs; the banking, berms, jumps and whoops are the ground's own heights,
    and the track's surface is drawn on the ground's own triangles (`genGround`), its look fading to grass at
    the edge where the ground's grass takes over, so the physics drives exactly what's drawn.
  - Laps are timed on the three circuits (over the line, past checkpoints at a third and two thirds, over the
    line again), the best kept for each car and level. On the strip: stop with the nose on the line in a lane,
    the tree counts down (the car is held on its brakes), then the slip: reaction time, 60 ft, 330 ft, the
    eighth mile and the speed. Flooring it before green is a red light.
- **The salt flats**: past about two miles (a rounded square, its edge wandering), flat, hard (the physics'
  `strip` surface) and endless, with City Limits' ramps (kickers, table-tops, mega ramps) in most 360 m cells.

## The night (`src/59_daynight.js`, `src/13_lit.js`)

One night, City Limits': a full moon bright enough to see the country and the salt. The town's ~1,100 lights
(street lamps, the boulevard's twin lamps, neon, shopfronts, the gas station, the diner, the garage) and the off-road
park's towers and poles are put into a grid of 8 m cells once (3.8 by 2.4 km, town and park), each cell listing the
lights that reach it, and the lit shader lights each
pixel from its cell's list (City Limits' cluster grid). The headlights and the farms' yard lights nearest the car
are the shader's own eight lamps, as in Back Forty.

## Checks

- `node tools/physcheck.js`: the existing cars' physics, still bit-identical (worst difference 0).
- `python3 tools/drive_check.py hwyE 70`: town to the end of the highway on the salt; no NaNs, no ground steps.
- `python3 tools/boot_check.py`, `tools/shot.py`, the rest of Back Forty's tools still apply.

- `python3 tools/park_drive.py oval,short,mud,strip 1 [car] [speed cap m/s]`: a robot lap of each circuit and a
  drag run; no NaNs, no ground steps, the lap clock and the slip.

## Next

- The super off-road circuit round the city.
- City Limits' career, challenges and jobs, with the Tune sheet as the shopping list in career.
- Robot racers (HD's drivers and Showdown's cross-country drivers).
